# Monthly programming challenges for the study.py group


## Formatting output

Printing output with color or styles can be very useful in debugging and logging.

**Problem:**

Design and implement your own markup language  

for example:
```
$ ./markup.py "<bold blue>What a wonderful world"
```
would print out "What a wonderfule world" in bold blue text.

Of course that is just an example. you should design your own markup language that you find to be intuitive and easy to read.

**Bonus:**

1. Try to make your code take in an entire file written in your markup language and output using your defined rules.


## Download and unzip file

**Problem:**
 
 1. Download a file from the internet. For this example we will use the WordPress installation package [here](https://wordpress.org/download/)  

    *Notes:* 
    - This will be a bit different than downloading and analysing a web page.
    - You should save the complete file on disk after it has been downloaded.
    - Downloading files can be useful in installing packages or scraping images or data for analysis
 
 2. Unzip the sample file and save it's contents to disk.
