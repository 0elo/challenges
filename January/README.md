# Welcome to 2018, January's Challenge

To start off the new year, the challenge will be to contribute to open-source projects through PyStudyGroup's **JanJam** (a blatant rip-off of Hacktoberfest)! This inaugural challenge encourages participation in open-source projects for their benefit, but it also provides an opportunity to learn how to - and experience the joy of - contributing. To participate in the challenge, you’ll need to submit one or more Pull Requests (PRs) during January to any public project. This challenge doesn’t require that you submit code. 

## What goes into a PR?
You can submit documentation enhancements, correct spelling errors, apply better PEP8 to someone’s code, add error handling or CLI arguments… the list goes on. The project doesn't even need to use Python!

## OK, here are the brackets

* Beginner: Submit 3 PRs
* Intermediate: Submit 3 PRs, one has to be python code
* Advanced: Submit 3 PRs, one has to be python code and include testing of the code submitted

By why stop there? Go nuts.

NOTE: Just because you've made a pull request, there's no guarantee that it'll be accepted.  A good maintainer will work with you to get your code merged, but they may make additional requests of you to do so.  Don't be afraid to assert what you know and don't, and have that conversation. Lastly, don't hesitate to reach out to others on either the #help or #challenges channels for assistance.
