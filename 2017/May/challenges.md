## [Beginner] Formatting output

Printing output with color or styles can be very useful in debugging and logging.

**Problem:**

Design and implement your own markup language  

for example:
```
$ ./markup.py "<bold blue>What a wonderful world"
```
would print out "What a wonderfule world" in bold blue text.

Of course that is just an example. you should design your own markup language that you find to be intuitive and easy to read.

**Bonus:**

1. Try to make your code take in an entire file written in your markup language and output using your defined rules.
