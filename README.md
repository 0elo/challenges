# Monthly Challenges [study.py]

This is the repository for the monthly challenges. Here you can:

* See the challenges for every month
* Upload your solutions to tasks

## Folder Structure

There is a toplevel folder for each Month. Inside you can find subfolders for every challenge.
Inside the monthly folder you can find the markdown document explaining the challenges.

* `May/`
  * `1_beginner/`
  * `2_web_scraping/`
  * `3_data/`
  * `challenges.md`

## How to submit solutions

Please name your python file as your Slack username. For me that would be `cripcate.py`.

1. Navigate to a folder on your machine where you would like to store the repository.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/py-study-group/challenges`.
3. Navigate into the folder for the correct month you're trying to submit to (e.g. `cd May`)
4. Navigate into the subfolder for the correct challenge you're trying to submit to (e.g. `cd 1_beginner`)
5. Copy your python script into the folder: `cp /path/to/script/[username].py .`
6. Add the file and commit the change: `git add [username].py` & `git commit -m "Added solution xy"`
