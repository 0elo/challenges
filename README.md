# Monthly Challenges [study.py]

This is the repository for the monthly challenges. Here you can:

* See the challenges for every month
* Upload your solutions to tasks

## Where to find the challenges

There is a toplevel folder for each Month. Inside you can find subfolders for every challenge. Inside the monthly folder you can find the markdown document explaining the challenges.

* May/
  * 1_beginner/
    * `username1.py`
    * `username2.py`
  * 2_web_scraping/
    * `username1.py`
  * 3_data/
  * **`challenges.md`**

## How to submit solutions

Please name your python file as your Slack username. For me that would be `cripcate.py`.

1. Navigate into the folder for the correct month you're trying to submit to (e.g. `cd May`)
2. Navigate into the sub-folder for the correct challenge you're trying to submit to (e.g. `cd 1_beginner`)
3. Upload your python script into the folder: ![uploading](https://i.imgur.com/gbdCvKF.png)
