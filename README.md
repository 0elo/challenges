# Monthly Challenges [study.py]

This is the repository for the monthly challenges. Here you can:

* See the challenges for every month
* Upload your solutions to tasks

## Where to find the challenges

There is a toplevel folder for each month with a `challenges.md` file that explains each challenge. Inside you will
find subfolders for every challenge where all submitted code is kept. For example:

* May/
  * README.md/
    * `username1.py`
    * `username2.py`

As you can see, each file is named after the Slack username of the submitter. 

## How to download challenges and solutions

You can clone the github repository to download all the files: `git clone https://github.com/py-study-group/challenges`

Or you can use the interface of the github website to download.

## How to submit solutions

### Initial setup 

First you will need to fork the [py-study-group/challenges repo](https://github.com/py-study-group/challenges). Your forked
repo is where you should put your solutions, and it is from here that you submit them to the [py-study-group/challenges repo](https://github.com/py-study-group/challenges). 

For details on how to accomplish this, please see: [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

### To submit a solution

#### Copy your solution to your forked repo

Once you have completed a challenge and wish to submit it, make sure that it exists in your forked repo under the appropriate month/challenge directory and named by your Slack username (for example, `cripcate.py`). 

For details on how to do this, please see: [Adding a file to a repository (web)](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) or [Adding a file to a repository (command line)](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/)

#### Create a pull request

Once your solution has been placed into your forked repo you should initiate a pull request into the main [py-study-group/challenges repo](https://github.com/py-study-group/challenges) so that your solution(s) can be merged. 

To create a pull request, please see: [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

Once your pull request has been submitted, an admin of the py-study-group will review and merge it into the [py-study-group/challenges repo](https://github.com/py-study-group/challenges) where it will be appear alongside all of the other submitted solutions.
